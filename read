I've got my mobile phone in my pocket.
My laptop's just in my filing cabinet in the office over there.
I have my mobile phone with me. And my mobile phone is connected to Twitter.
I have an iPod, but it's not charged.
On me at the moment, I just have my mobile.
I couldn't live without my laptop.
I couldn't live without my computer, because I'm on it all the time.
My phone. I think beyond that, I don't need anything else.
I don't think I could live without my mobile phone.
I couldn't live without the Internet, because I depend on it.
